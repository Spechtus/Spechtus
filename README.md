## 🚀 About Me
I’m passionate about building **scalable AI systems** that bridge the gap between research and production.  
Over the past years, I’ve worked on **recommendation engines, chatbots, real-time analytics pipelines, and trend detection systems** – always with the goal of turning data into **impactful, user-facing products**.  

Currently at **B1 SmartTV GmbH**, I’m focusing on:  
- 🧠 Developing & deploying **personalized recommendation systems**  
- 🤖 Building **chatbots and NLP pipelines** to automate support & marketing workflows  
- 🔄 Designing **CI/CD pipelines for ML models** with automated retraining & monitoring  
- 📊 Delivering **production-ready datasets and analytics** to support decision-making  
- ⚡ Optimizing ML for **real-time, large-scale production use**
